    I’m an engineer working on multimodal AI systems at Google.
  </p>

  <p>
    Recently I’ve been working on <strong>Search AI Mode</strong> and Lens-related projects,
    where I’ve focused on improving how models understand and use visual information.
    That includes building and evaluating multimodal features such as visual search tools,
    and more recently improving quality in multimodal multi-turn interactions by ensuring
    visual context flows correctly across turns.
  </p>

  <p>
    A lot of my work sits at the boundary between modeling and infrastructure —
    thinking about how tools are exposed to models, how visual signals are represented,
    and where grounding breaks in real user traffic.
  </p>

  <p>
    Earlier, I worked on <strong>Google Maps</strong>, using large-scale GPS data
    to predict lane marker locations and enrich navigation data.

<h2>Outside of Work</h2>

<p>
  I like taking photos — mostly cities, light, and small details I’d probably
  ignore if I were moving faster. I don’t have a gallery here (yet),
  but maybe one day.
</p>

<p>
  I watch a lot of anime. Sometimes that turns into going down
  very specific rabbit holes about old merchandise and obscure prints.
</p>

<p>
  I also recently started playing badminton.
  I’m still very new and mostly chasing the shuttle in the wrong direction,
  but it’s been fun learning something completely different.
