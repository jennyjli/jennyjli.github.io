    <p>
      Engineer working on conversational AI systems and multi-turn interaction quality.
      Currently at Google, focused on improving how models reason across conversations.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m interested in long-horizon AI interaction, memory, and how humans collaborate
      with intelligent systems over time.
