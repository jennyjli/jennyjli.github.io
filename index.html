      I’m an engineer working on multimodal AI systems at Google. Over the past several years I’ve worked across Google Maps and Lens, and more recently on Search AI Mode, focusing on how models understand and reason over visual information across multiple turns of interaction.
    </p>

    <p>
      My work sits at the intersection of perception, grounding, and conversation — from predicting lane structure using large-scale GPS data, to enabling visual search tools, to improving multimodal multi-turn quality by ensuring models retain visual context across interactions.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m particularly interested in how AI systems move beyond single prompts toward longer-horizon collaboration with users, where memory, tools, and grounding become first-class problems.

      This site is a place where I experiment and build smaller ideas in public.
